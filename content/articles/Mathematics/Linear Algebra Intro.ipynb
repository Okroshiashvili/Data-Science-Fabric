    "Linear algebra is one of the building block of data science among others. Its importance is huge, as all supervised, unsupervised and semi-supervised algorithms use it with some degree. One great example is Google's famous [Page Rank](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/PageRank) algorithm, which heavily relies on it. And that is not all. We can find as many usage cases of linear algebra as many individuals exist in the data science field.\n",

    "Let's start explaining word by word the definition of linear algebra. Loosely speaking, [mathematical structure](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mathematical_structure) is a set, together with a family of operations and relations defined on that set. Now divide \"Closed under addition and scalar multiplication\" into two parts. First is \"closed under addition\" which means that a set is \"closed under addition\" if the sum of any two members of this set belongs to this set again. For example, imagine the set of even integers. Then, take any to integer and add them up. The result is an even integer belonging to the initial set. Here is a mathematical definition.\n",
