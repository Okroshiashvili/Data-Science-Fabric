My name is Nodar Okroshiashvili. I am [Okroshiashvili](https://github.com/Okroshiashvili/) on Github, [@N_Okroshiashvil](https://twitter.com/N_Okroshiashvil/) on Twitter, and [nodar-okroshiashvili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nodar-okroshiashvili/) on LinkedIn. You can also reach me via [email](mailto:n.okroshiashvili@gmail.com).

I work for [MaxinAI](https://maxinai.com/), which is an AI consultancy company based in Tbilisi, Georgia. I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer. Long story short, I do lots of data scraping, parsing, pre-processing, wrangling, mining, and data management.

I hold BS in Business Administration, MA in Economics and started my Ph.D. at Georgian Technical University in the artificial intelligence department. My research is concerned about natural language processing and my research thesis is "Georgian Automatic Multilingual Semantic Translator".

With this blog, I will try to write about my journey in data science. The learning path I chose and the adventures I had during that time. Moreover, this blog will serve the purpose to help aspiring data scientists, not to make the same mistakes as I did, when starting the transition from economics to data science.

Besides programming, I do programming, and besides all that I love fishing. My motto is: Do it, and do it right now.
