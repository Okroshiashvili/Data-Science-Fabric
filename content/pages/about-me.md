My name is Nodar Okroshiashvili. I am [Okroshiashvili](https://github.com/Okroshiashvili/) on Github, [@N_Okroshiashvil](https://twitter.com/N_Okroshiashvil/) on Twitter, and [nodar-okroshiashvili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nodar-okroshiashvili/) on LinkedIn. You can also reach me via [email](mailto:n.okroshiashvili@gmail.com).

I work for [MaxinAI](https://maxinai.com/), an AI consultancy company based in Tbilisi, Georgia. I am a data scientist and machine learning engineer. Long story short, I do lots of data scraping, parsing, pre-processing, wrangling, mining, and data management. Previously, I worked as a marketing data scientists and data analyst in two different commercial banks.

I hold a BS in Business Administration, MA in Economics, and started my Ph.D. at Georgian Technical University. My research area is computational linguistics.

With this blog, I want to tell a story about my journey in data science and machine learning. The learning path I chose and the adventures I had during that time.
