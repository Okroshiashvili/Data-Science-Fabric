My name is Nodar Okroshiashvili. I am [Okroshiashvili](https://github.com/Okroshiashvili/) on Github, [@N_Okroshiashvil](https://twitter.com/N_Okroshiashvil/) on Twitter, and [nodar-okroshiashvili](https://www.linkedin.com/in/nodar-okroshiashvili/) on LinkedIn. You can also reach me via [email](mailto:n.okroshiashvili@gmail.com).


I work for Credo bank, which is a local commercial bank. I am a data scientist at Research and Development unit, which is under Marketing Department. Long story short, I model consumer behaviour, using various ML  techniques and based on analysis create products and offer those products to consumer. I hold BS in Business Administration, MA in Economics and currently attending my PhD, again in Economics. I try to help aspiring data scientist, not to make the same mistakes as I did, when starting transition from Economics to Data Science.</p><p>Besides programming, I do programming, and besides all that I love fishing. My motto is: Do it, and do it right now.
